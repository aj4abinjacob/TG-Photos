# TGPhotos
Google photos alternative using telegram
Since free use of google photos is comming to an end, i needed an alternative so i ended up using telegram bot api to create a free cloud like enviornment.
I will be sharing the python script i created it currently works on linux.
I will be also sharing an xml file which can be used in an android phone having tasker installed to upload to telegram in the same way.
